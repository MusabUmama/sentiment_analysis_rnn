# RNN Sentiment Analysis for Yelp Reviews

Description:

This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for the Yelp Reviews dataset. The project focuses on analyzing text reviews from Yelp and determining sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each review.

Key Features:

Utilizes RNN/LSTM architectures to understand the sequential nature of text data.
Preprocesses the Yelp dataset, tokenizes text, and handles label encoding for sentiment analysis.
Trains the RNN model on the Yelp Reviews dataset to predict sentiment.
Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage:

Clone the repository and follow the README instructions to set up the environment.
Explore the notebooks/scripts to understand the model implementation and training process.
Use or extend the codebase for other sentiment analysis tasks or datasets.
